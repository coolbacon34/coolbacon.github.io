		<p style="font-size: 15px">
			The South Vietnamese Army (SVA) had been financed by America throughout the late1950’s, 1960’s and as a result of Vietnamisation, to an even greater degree from 1970 to 1975. The South Vietnamese Army first took shape after the 1954 Geneva Agreement when the American Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) commanded by Lieutenant General John O’Daniel set about creating a modern military force, funded by the US, that was capable of defending South Vietnam against an invasion by troops from North Vietnam.

			<p>U.S. Air Force and Navy, together with Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVAF), conducted an aerial bombardment campaign against North Vietnam known as Operation Rolling Thunder. One of its main objectives was to destroy the Ho Chi Minh trail which was a North Vietnamese logistical system that ran from North Vietnam through Laos, Cambodia and to South Vietnam to provide support in forms of manpower and materiel to the Viet Cong (NLF). The campaign, which lasted for more than three years from March 2, 1965 to November 2, 1968, became the most aggressive air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period.</p>

			<p>In theory, South Vietnam was very well equipped to defend itself. In the mid-1960’s it had a large, modern and well-equipped army and a similar militia both of which were equipped and funded by the world’s most powerful nation – America. In 1965, the Americans added their huge military prowess to assist South Vietnam. Despite this, by 1975, the SVA was in tatters and the North had defeated the South.</p>
